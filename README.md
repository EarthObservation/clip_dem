> Added r2t_susa_index.py as an example how I handled extraction of small areas (polygons from SHP file) from a large raster. 


## clip_vrt_dem.py

Creates a clipped DEM from a VRT file and saves it as GeoTIFF. Inputs are extents (bbox), but can be quickly
changed to use polygons instead (from SHP file).

## create_vrt.py

Creates a VRT file (GDAL) from a list of TIFF files.
